SideSwiper
==========

A Side Swipe driven demo as seen on Facebook / Foursquare / Twist etc.

This code provides a demo of how to implement a side swipe menu. Feel free to download and use as you please.

The code implements the following functionality --

1. A root SSSwipeViewController that takes 2 view controllers as input arguments ( main and left )
2. Adds a UINavigationController around the main view controller.
3. Adds a delegate on the left view controller to pass messages back to the SSSwipeViewController.
4. Subclasses UINavigationController, UIScrollView and UIView to achieve the desired effect.
